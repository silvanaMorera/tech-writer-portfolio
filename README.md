# API Documentation Portfolio

This repository showcases my approach to documenting APIs.  
Each sample focuses on solving real developer pain points while demonstrating different documentation styles.

## Why Two Styles?

API documentation isn’t one-size-fits-all.  
Developers need different entry points depending on whether they’re onboarding or building a production integration.

- OpenWeather API → *Tutorial focused*  
  - Simple tasks (current weather, forecasts, localization).  
  - Shows how I write approachable guides that help developers succeed in under 5 minutes.  

- CoinGecko API → Reference focused
  - Detailed tasks with parameter tables, pagination rules, rate limits, and error handling.  
  - Shows how I handle complex APIs and surface details where developers actually need them.
