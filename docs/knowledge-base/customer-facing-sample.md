1. Make sure the customer has an stable internet connection (WIFI). 
2. Advise the customer to check their spam/junk folder. 
3. Suggest the customer to wait from three to five as sometimes the carrier may take some time to receive our link. 
4. It is unlikely the customer entered both their email and phone number incorrectly, so ask probing questions to determine whether the customer has checked both their text messages and email for the eSign link.
   - If the customer has checked, and confirms that they entered both their email and phone number incorrectly, continue to major step 5. 
   - If the customer finds the eSign link, advise them that they can proceed with signing the agreement. 
5. If the customer confirms that they entered both their email and phone number incorrectly, withdraw the customer's application and advise the customer to reapply with their correct phone number and email address.
